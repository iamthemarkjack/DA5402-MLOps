# Grafana Dashboard with Prometheus and Node Exporter

This repository contains the JSON file of the Grafana dashboard, a preview snapshot (`snapshot.png`), and a one-minute screen recording (`screen_recording.webm`) demonstrating the dashboard auto-refreshing every 5 seconds.

The Grafana dashboard monitors the following system metrics:
- **CPU Utilization** (Overall and per individual thread)
- **Memory Usage** (Total installed, used, and swapped memory)
- **Network I/O** (Send and receive speeds)
- **Disk Storage** (Available space)
- **Disk Activity** (Read and write operations)
